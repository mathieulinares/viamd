# Force Field Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the force field improvements implemented to address:
1. Missing dihedral angle forces 
2. Distance overestimation issues

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Dihedral Force Support

**Problem**: The OpenMM force field implementation was missing dihedral (torsional) forces, which are critical for proper molecular conformation and dynamics.

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive dihedral parameter structures for both AMBER and UFF force fields
- Implemented dihedral parameter lookup functions with extensive parameter tables
- Integrated `OpenMM::PeriodicTorsionForce` into both force field setup routines
- Added proper enumeration of all 4-atom dihedral patterns in molecular structures

**Technical Details**:
- Added `AmberDihedralType` and `UffDihedralType` structures with force constants (k), phase angles (phi0), and periodicity (n)
- Implemented `get_amber_dihedral_params()` and `get_uff_dihedral_params()` functions with fallback hierarchies
- Parameters cover protein backbone dihedrals (phi/psi angles), side chain rotations, and generic sp3/sp2/aromatic patterns
- Uses OpenMM's periodic torsion potential: `V = k * (1 + cos(n*phi - phi0))`

### 2. Fixed Distance Overestimation

**Problem**: Bond lengths were using input molecular geometry when deemed "reasonable" (0.05-0.30 nm), leading to overestimated distances when input structures had incorrect bond lengths.

**Solution**: 
- Removed logic that conditionally used input geometry bond lengths
- Now always uses force field equilibrium bond lengths (`bond_params.r0`)
- Ensures consistent, physically correct bond lengths regardless of input structure quality

**Technical Details**:
- Modified both AMBER and UFF bond setup to use `bond_params.r0` directly
- Removed distance calculation and conditional override logic
- Bond lengths now strictly follow force field parameters

## Impact

### Simulation Quality
- **More accurate molecular conformations** due to proper dihedral constraints
- **Correct bond lengths** eliminating distance overestimation artifacts
- **Better energy landscapes** with realistic torsional barriers
- **Improved sampling** of conformational space

### Force Field Coverage
- **AMBER14**: Enhanced with protein backbone and side chain dihedrals
- **UFF**: Enhanced with sp3/sp2/aromatic torsional patterns  
- **Both**: Complete 4-term potential (bonds + angles + dihedrals + non-bonded)

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- No changes to public interfaces
- Existing simulations will benefit automatically from improvements

## Validation

The improvements were validated through:
1. **Parameter verification**: Confirmed realistic force constants and barriers
2. **Bond length testing**: Verified force field parameters are used consistently  
3. **Integration testing**: Ensured proper OpenMM force integration
4. **Compilation testing**: Verified code changes compile without errors

## Files Modified

- `src/components/openmm/openmm.cpp`: Main implementation with dihedral forces and bond length fixes
- `test_force_field_improvements.cpp`: Validation test (can be removed from final build)

## Force Field Parameters Added

### AMBER Dihedrals
- Protein backbone: phi (C-N-CA-C) and psi (N-CA-C-N) angles
- Side chain rotations: chi1 and other common patterns
- Generic fallbacks for unknown atom type combinations

### UFF Dihedrals  
- sp3-sp3: alkyl chain rotations with 3-fold symmetry
- sp2-sp2: conjugated systems with 2-fold barriers
- Aromatic: planar constraints with high barriers
- Heteroatom: N, O, S containing dihedrals

This implementation provides a solid foundation for accurate molecular dynamics simulations while maintaining the existing VIAMD architecture and usability.
