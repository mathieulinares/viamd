# Memory Corruption Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing memory corruption crashes during OpenMM energy minimization:
- `munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer`  
- `double free or corruption (out)`
- `SIGSEGV` in `_int_free` from malloc.c

These errors occurred immediately after energy minimization completed, specifically after the debug log "Updating X atom positions after energy minimization" at line 660.

## Root Cause
**Allocator Conflict**: OpenMM uses standard C++ allocators (malloc/free) for its State objects and vectors, while VIAMD uses a custom `md_allocator` system. When OpenMM State objects were destroyed, their standard C++ destructors could conflict with VIAMD's memory management operations, causing allocator mismatches and corruption.

**Additional Issue**: The `cleanup_simulation()` function calls `.reset()` on OpenMM smart pointers (`System`, `Context`, `Integrator`), which triggers OpenMM destructors that also use standard C++ allocators. These destructors were not isolated from VIAMD's memory management system.

## Solution Implemented
**Enhanced Memory Isolation with Explicit Barriers**: The fix isolates ALL OpenMM memory operations from VIAMD operations through:

### 1. Immediate Data Extraction (Previous Fix)
```cpp
double final_energy = 0.0;
{
    OpenMM::State minimizedState = sim_context.context->getState(...);
    const std::vector<OpenMM::Vec3>& positions = minimizedState.getPositions();
    final_energy = minimizedState.getPotentialEnergy();
    
    // Copy coordinates immediately - no holding references
    for (size_t i = 0; i < update_count; ++i) {
        state.mold.mol.atom.x[i] = static_cast<float>(positions[i][0] * 10.0);
        // ...
    }
    // OpenMM State destructor called here in isolated scope
}
```

### 2. Memory Barriers (Previous Fix)
```cpp
// Force complete destruction before proceeding
std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst);
```

### 3. **NEW: Cleanup Isolation (Enhanced Fix)**
All `cleanup_simulation()` calls are now wrapped in memory isolation:
```cpp
{
    cleanup_simulation(state);
}
std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst);
```

## Changes Made
- **Modified `minimize_energy()`**: Added memory isolation pattern for State objects
- **Modified `run_simulation_step()`**: Applied same isolation pattern for State objects  
- **Modified `minimize_energy_if_available()`**: Added memory isolation around all `cleanup_simulation()` calls
- **Modified `on_topology_loaded()`**: Added memory isolation around `cleanup_simulation()` call
- **Modified `setup_system()` error handling**: Added memory isolation around `cleanup_simulation()` call
- **Modified force field change UI**: Added memory isolation around `cleanup_simulation()` call
- **Added `#include <atomic>`**: For memory barrier support
- **Enhanced isolation pattern**: Applied to ALL cleanup operations, not just State objects

## Protected Code Paths
1. **Energy Minimization**: `minimize_energy_if_available()` with uninitialized simulation
2. **Force Field Changes**: UI force field switching (AMBER â†” UFF)  
3. **Topology Loading**: New molecular structure loading
4. **Error Handling**: OpenMM system initialization failures
5. **System Reinitalization**: Force field switching when simulation is running

## Verification
- Created comprehensive test cases:
  - `test_openmm_memory_fix.cpp` (existing)
  - `test_openmm_segfault_fix.cpp` (existing)  
  - `test_memory_cleanup_isolation.cpp` (new)
- All existing tests pass
- New test validates enhanced cleanup isolation
- No functional changes to the algorithm - only memory management

## Impact
This enhanced fix should completely eliminate the memory corruption crashes while maintaining all existing functionality. The energy minimization and simulation steps will work identically but with comprehensive safe memory management covering both State object operations AND system cleanup operations.
