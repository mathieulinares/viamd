# Memory Corruption Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing memory corruption crashes during OpenMM energy minimization:
- `munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer`  
- `double free or corruption (out)`

These errors occurred immediately after energy minimization completed, specifically after the debug log "Updating X atom positions after energy minimization" at line 660.

## Root Cause
**Allocator Conflict**: OpenMM uses standard C++ allocators (malloc/free) for its State objects and vectors, while VIAMD uses a custom `md_allocator` system. When OpenMM State objects were destroyed, their standard C++ destructors could conflict with VIAMD's memory management operations, causing allocator mismatches and corruption.

## Solution Implemented
**Memory Isolation with Explicit Barriers**: The fix isolates OpenMM memory operations from VIAMD operations through:

### 1. Immediate Data Extraction
```cpp
double final_energy = 0.0;
{
    OpenMM::State minimizedState = sim_context.context->getState(...);
    const std::vector<OpenMM::Vec3>& positions = minimizedState.getPositions();
    final_energy = minimizedState.getPotentialEnergy();
    
    // Copy coordinates immediately - no holding references
    for (size_t i = 0; i < update_count; ++i) {
        state.mold.mol.atom.x[i] = static_cast<float>(positions[i][0] * 10.0);
        // ...
    }
    // OpenMM State destructor called here in isolated scope
}
```

### 2. Memory Barriers
```cpp
// Force complete destruction before proceeding
std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst);
```

### 3. Deferred Operations
All logging and other operations happen after the memory barrier, ensuring OpenMM memory is completely released.

## Changes Made
- **Modified `minimize_energy()`**: Added memory isolation pattern
- **Modified `run_simulation_step()`**: Applied same isolation pattern  
- **Added `#include <atomic>`**: For memory barrier support
- **Extracted data immediately**: No holding references past OpenMM object lifetime
- **Added memory barriers**: Explicit sequencing of memory operations

## Verification
- Created comprehensive test case (`test_memory_corruption_fix.cpp`)
- All existing tests pass (`test_openmm_memory_fix.cpp`, `test_openmm_segfault_fix.cpp`)
- No functional changes to the algorithm - only memory management

## Impact
This fix should completely eliminate the memory corruption crashes while maintaining all existing functionality. The energy minimization and simulation steps will work identically but with safe memory management.
